## 3. Active Open Findings & Technical Debt


### 🟡 High Priority
- **Missing Vercel Production Environment Variables**:
  - `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, and `NODE_ENV=production` must be set in Vercel Project Settings.
- **Dual Backend Divergence**:
  - `apps/api/` (standalone Node dev/test) vs `apps/web/server/` (production Vercel serverless). Changes must currently be duplicated across both codebases.
- **In-Memory Rate Limiting on Serverless**:
  - [rateLimit.middleware.js](file:///e:/project%20emp/tbi/apps/web/server/middleware/rateLimit.middleware.js) uses in-memory `Map`. On Vercel lambdas, state resets on cold starts and does not share across concurrent instances.

### 🟢 Medium / Architectural
- **Socket.io on Serverless**:
  - WebSocket real-time chat cannot maintain persistent connections on Vercel serverless functions. Polling fallback works, but real-time push requires a standalone persistent server (or external provider like Pusher / Ably).
- **Missing MongoDB Indexes**:
  - Missing indexes on `Review` (`studentId`, `eventId`), `Certificate` (`studentId`, `issuedAt`), `Application` (`studentId`, `teamId`), and `Team` (`leadId`).
- **Heavy Tasks Running in HTTP Process**:
  - Email sending and PDF generation run synchronously inside the API service rather than being offloaded to dedicated BullMQ workers.
- **Client Bundle Size**:
  - [apps/web/src/App.jsx](file:///e:/project%20emp/tbi/apps/web/src/App.jsx) statically imports all pages, resulting in a single monolithic >900kB bundle without route-based code-splitting (`React.lazy`).
