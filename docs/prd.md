## 1. Product Overview

A centralized, admin-provisioned web platform that replaces WhatsApp groups, spreadsheets, and email chains for running TBI-GEU's (Technology Business Incubator) event workforce.
Covers the full event lifecycle:
**Event creation → Team assembly → Auto-created chat rooms → Student applications → Approval → QR attendance → Certificate verification → Analytics.**

No public self-signup. All accounts are created by Admin or Super Admin and distributed with temporary credentials.

## 3. Current Production Features (Verified in Code)

### 3.1 Authentication & Security
- **Admin-Provisioned Login**: Login with email and password ([apps/web/server/modules/auth/](file:///e:/project%20emp/tbi/apps/web/server/modules/auth/)). Forgot password and self-signup links removed.
- **Forced First-Login Password Change**: `needsPasswordChange` flag forces immediate update on initial login.
- **MFA (TOTP)**: Mandatory for `ADMIN` and `SUPER_ADMIN` via `apps/web/server/modules/auth/mfa.service.js`.
